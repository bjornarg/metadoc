\section{Useful classes and modules}
\label{sec:useful_classes}
The MetaDoc client defines a series of classes and modules that are used to
define the XML data passed between client and server. 

\texttt{MetaElement} refers to \texttt{metaelement.MetaElement}, and
\texttt{MetaDoc} refers to \\ \texttt{metaelement.MetaElement}.

\subsection{MetaDoc}
The class \texttt{MetaDoc} is used to define the document itself. It provides
functionality to alter the document structure, find elements within the
document and generate XML data from the document. It contains a series of
\texttt{MetaElement} sub classes that defines the content within the document.

\subsection{MetaElement}
\texttt{MetaElement} is used to define content within the document.  The class
is ment to be a parent class for other classes that defines particular
elements. An element is equal to an XML tag, such as \texttt{<users>} or
\texttt{<resourceUp>} in a MetaDoc XML document. An instance of such a sub
class is used to define a particular tag in the XML document, with attributes
and content.  

\subsubsection{Class variables}

Each \texttt{MetaElement} sub class should define a class variable
\textbf{xml\_tag\_name}, that should be a string containing the name of the XML
tag the class describes. For a sub class defining the \texttt{<users>} tag,
this should be set to ``users``. 

A \texttt{MetaElement} sub class that defines a main container element, that
is, an element that is placed as a direct child of the root node
\texttt{<MetaDoc>} in the XML document, should also define a class variable
\textbf{url} that is a string containing the particular part of the URL that is
used to send or retrieve information for the data type passed. If the type of
data is a list of users, and it should retrieve the list of users from the url
\textbf{/baseurl/users/}, the \textbf{url} class variable should be set to
``users``.

The classes that define a main container element should also define either the
class variable \textbf{update\_handler} or \textbf{site\_handler}, depending on
whether the data is ment to be recieved from the server or sent from the
client, respectively. 

\textbf{update\_handler} should be a sub class of
\texttt{custom.abstract.MetaInput}. This class should be placed in
\texttt{custom.update<name>.Update<Name>}, so for users this would be
\texttt{custom.updateusers.UpdateUsers}. When data of the type defined by the
\texttt{MetaElement} sub class is recieved, an instance of
\textbf{update\_handler} will be created, and the instance's
\textbf{self.items} will be populated with a list of \texttt{MetaElement} sub
classes. Then the \textbf{update\_handler}'s \texttt{process()} function will
be called.  Normally, \textbf{self.items} should be of length 1.

\textbf{site\_handler} should be a sub class of
\texttt{custom.abstract.MetaOutput}. This class should be placed in
\texttt{custom.site<name>.Site<Name>}, so for events this would be
\texttt{custom.siteevents.SiteEvents}. When the script is called to send data
of the type defined by the \texttt{MetaElement} sub class, an instance of
\textbf{site\_handler} is created, and the instance's \texttt{populate()}
function is called. \texttt{populate()} should populate the instance's
\textbf{self.items} with a list of \texttt{MetaElement} sub classes. When
\texttt{populate()} is done, \textbf{self.items} is added to the
\texttt{MetaElement} sub class instance's \textbf{self.sub\_elements}.

\subsubsection{Allowed sub elements}
There are certain restrictions on what classes can be placed within a
\texttt{MetaElement} sub class instance's \textbf{self.sub\_elements}, because
not every XML tag can have any other XML tag as children. A
\texttt{MetaElement} sub class therefor defines a \\
\textbf{self.legal\_element\_types}. This should be a list of
\texttt{MetaElement} sub classes that are allowed to be children of the XML
current \texttt{MetaElement} sub class. 

As an example, if \texttt{Users} is a \texttt{MetaElement} sub class defining
the \texttt{<users>} XML tag, and \texttt{UserEntry} is a \texttt{MetaElement}
sub class defining the \texttt{<user\_entry>} XML tag, which can be a child of
\texttt{<users>} in the XML document, a \texttt{Users} instance would have
\texttt{UserEntry} in it's \textbf{self.legal\_element\_types}.

\subsubsection{Tag attributes}
A tag may have attributes set. These should be defined in the
\texttt{MetaElement} sub class' \texttt{\_\_init\_\_()} function. They
\textit{must} have the same name as the attribute has in the XML document. If
an attribute is optional in the XML element, it should also be optional in
\texttt{\_\_init\_\_()}. 

The sub class should in it's \texttt{\_\_init\_\_()} function figure out what
attributes are availible and which are not, and pass these on to the
\texttt{MetaElement} \texttt{\_\_init\_\_()} function through \texttt{super()}. 

\subsection{UniqueID}
The \texttt{utils} module provides a class called \texttt{UniqueID} that can
provide a unique identifier to objects passed through the function
\texttt{get\_id()}. This should be used for entries passed from client to
server to set as the \textbf{id} attribute so that the server can properly
identify the entry when returning a receipt. 

\subsection{Examples}

\subsubsection{Connection figure}
Figure \ref{fig:connection_example} shows an example of how these connections
work. Here the definition of projects is shown, with connections to the XML
document, DTD, server URL and \textbf{update\_handler}.
