\section{Dependencies}

\subsection{lxml}
The MetaDoc client itself is only dependent on the \verb@lxml@ library outside
the Python standard library. 

The client may run without \verb@lxml@, in which case it will fall back to the
\verb@xml.etree.ElementTree@ library, which is a part of the Python standard
library. However, this will remove the \gls{dtd} validation feature. It will
also cause a slight performance hit to the client.

\subsection{yaml}
The custom example for site configuration uses the \verb@yaml@ library for
Python. If this is unavailable, this custom example will not work.
