\section{Errors}
\label{sec:errors}

The server returns a \texttt{<receipt>} containing an \texttt{<r\_entry>}
\textit{for each} element passed. The \texttt{<r\_entry>} has the required
attributes \textbf{id} and \textbf{code}, containing the ID of the element sent
by the client and the error code, respectively. It may also contain an
attribute \textbf{note} with a short note explaining the error if extra
information is availible. The \texttt{<r\_entry>} tag might also contain text
with a longer message, if more information is needed about the error. 

An example of a error message would be an error code \texttt{2001} with the
note \texttt{Missing attribute "reason"}.

\subsection{Document errors}

In the special case where there are problems with the document itself, such as 
XML errors or the document not passing DTD verification, the \texttt{<r\_entry>} 
\textbf{id} attribute will be set to \texttt{0} (zero), reffering to the 
document itself.
