\section{Introduction}
This guide is meant to provide a quick introduction to using MetaDoc and the
\gls{mapi}. For more complete information about MetaDoc, please refer to the
MetaDoc Documentation \cite{mdoc}.

\section{Needed information}
Before starting to install the MetaDoc client you need some information about
the MetaDoc server your client should connect to. The following information is
needed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item
        The host (URL) of the MetaDoc server
    \item
        The version of MetaDoc the server is running
    \item
        A certificate authority file that signed the MetaDoc server
        certificate.
    \item
        Whether the server uses a trailing slash on URIs
\end{itemize}

You also need a way to securely transport your certificate to the server.

\section{Retrieving the MetaDoc client}
Before you start you need a version of the MetaDoc client. You can download the
client from the MetaDoc GitHub repository \cite{downloads}. Please make sure
you download the same version as the one running on the server. 

Extract the client to the wanted destination. 

\section{Setting up folders}
The MetaDoc client uses two system folders, namely \texttt{/var/log/mapi/} and
\\ \texttt{/var/cache/mapi/} for log files and cache files, respectively. Make
sure to create these folders, and make sure the user running the MetaDoc client
has access to \textbf{read} and \textbf{write} to these folders. 

\section{Creating a X.509 certificate}
\label{sec:cert_gen}
MetaDoc uses X.509 certificates to identify the client on the server, and
ensure that the data is safely encrypted. 

The following command generates such a certificate. The value for \verb@-subj@
is not important, but dropping it will cause \verb@openssl@ to prompt for these
values.

\begin{verbatim}
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout client.key -out client.crt 
-nodes -subj "/C=NO/O=example.org/CN=localhost"
\end{verbatim}

The file \verb@client.crt@ must be sent to the server where it is bound to the
site. This should be the same site name set in the configuration value
\textbf{site\_name} (see section \ref{sec:config}).

\section{Configuring the MetaDoc client}
\label{sec:config}
The MetaDoc client uses a configuration file called \texttt{metadoc.conf} in
the same folder as the client itself. You can create a sample configuration
file by running \texttt{mapi.py} without any parameters. 

The configuration file contains the following settings:

\begin{description}
    \item[host] URI of a server responding to the MetaDoc server API
        \cite{mdoc}.
    \item[key]  Location of file containing the private key for the client
    (client.key from section \ref{sec:cert_gen}).
    \item[cert] Location of file containing the certificate for the client key
    (client.crt from section \ref{sec:cert_gen}).
    \item[site\_name]   Name of the site. This must correspond to the site name
        set on the server for the given certificate.
    \item[ca\_certs]    Location of file containing CA certificates that sign
        the key for the MetaDoc server.
    \item[trailing\_slash]   Whether the server uses a trailing slash on URIs.
        Should be set to True or False.
    \item[valid]    Defaults to False to avoid the script from running with
        default configuration. Should be set to True or removed once properly
        configured.
\end{description}

Please note that file locations \textbf{must} be given as an absolute path.

The certificate file referenced by the \textbf{cert} key in the configuration
must be available at the server and related to your client properly, otherwise
the server will refuse the connection.

\section{Using the information}
Once the actions detailed above have been performed, the MetaDoc client is
ready to send and receive information. However, it has to know what to do with
the information it receives, and how to gather information to send. 

\texttt{doc/examples/} contains examples of customized functions that produce a
shadow file from user data received, project user file from project data and
project quota file from received allocation data. It also contains an example
of a command line tool for adding events.

Please refer to the MetaDoc documentation \cite{mdoc} for more information on
customizing the MetaDoc client. 

\section{Setting up crontab}
The MetaDoc client can be set up as a crontab in order to synchronize sites
with the server. Below, some examples of using the client in crontab is shown.
The information passed between the client and server depends on the handles
passed on script execution. 

A couple of useful handles are \textbf{--send-all} and \textbf{--fetch-all},
which sends all data and retrieves all data, respectively. \textbf{--all} is a
combination of these.  See the MetaDoc documentation for a detailed explanation
of each handle \cite{mdoc}.

\begin{verbatim}
0  0  *  *  *  /path/to/metadoc/client/mapi.py -ecs -q -l error
\end{verbatim}
Sends event, configuration and software data to the server at midnight every
night. Makes sure the script executes quietly, passing no output to
\texttt{stdout}, only to \texttt{stderr} if the script execution fails. Only
logs error messages.

\begin{verbatim}
0  0  *  *  0  /path/to/metadoc/client/mapi.py -upa -q -l warning
\end{verbatim}
Fetches user, project and allocation data once a week. Makes sure the script
executes quietly and logs warning messages.

\section{Logging}
The MetaDoc client logs to \texttt{/var/log/mapi/}, log files follow the naming
schema \texttt{metadoc.client.YYYY-mm-dd.log}. The amount of information logged
depends on the log level passed to \textbf{-l} on script execution. The
possible log levels are \textbf{debug}, \textbf{info}, \textbf{warning},
\textbf{error} and \textbf{critical}. When \textbf{-l} is not passed, or passed
with a log level not available, the level is set to \textbf{warning}. See the
MetaDoc documentation for more information on logging \cite{mdoc}.
