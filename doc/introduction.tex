\section{Introduction}
MetaDoc is created as a way to securely transport data between a server and 
sites. It is created to improve the flow of information between \gls{hpc} sites
and Uninett Sigma \cite{improvingflow}.

MetaDoc consists of a client, running at the site, and a server running at the
Metacenter. MetaDoc takes care of authenticating the client on the server,
packing and unpacking the data to and from \gls{xml}, and transporting the data
securely between client and server.
